# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is an if statement. It uses conditions inside the if statement to check a Boolean(true, false), relativity (greater than, less than, equal to), and can compare using not (!), and (&&), or (||). At Learn Academy I used conditional statements to check if a users input like a grade number to return their letter grade.

  Researched answer: Conditionals are also called decision structures, or decision trees. They are often used in programming to have a statement make a decision based on the value of the input. The operator name for !,&&, and || is called logical operators. There is also something called a ternary operator (?, :) that gives the computer a question with two choices and returns the first or second value.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control software. The difference between git and GitHub is that gitHub acts as a remote GUI for git. I have used git through terminal and collaborated on group projects at Learn Academy by pushing to GitHub.

  Researched answer: Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds who also created Linux. Git stands for global information tracker, and is a free open source version control software for your local. GitHub is a remote (web based) that is used to upload Git repositories, and act as a GUI.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: I am not certain that these are the only operators that return true or false values, but I have used and (&&), or (||), and not (!).

  Researched answer: Logical operators do return Boolean values, equality (== , ===) and relational operators ( < , > , >= , <= ) do too.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is like an apartment building. Inside the building there are numbered apartments, and each index is an apartment. I know that arrays and strings are indexed. I am not certain but I think the difference between index and value is that indexes are organized, and data can be pulled out of them at specific points in the index. Values are individual pieces of data.

  Researched answer: In an array, each thing inside of it must be a JavaScript data type - and that is called an element. The content of that element is a value. As opposed to index which is the element's specific location in the array. This concept can be applied to strings too, each letter is a value but also has a specific location in the index.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is repeating the same process over and over again. In my experience I have used iteration in for loops. I made a loop that can iterate from one to ten and tell me which numbers are odd and which numbers are even.

  Researched answer: Iteration repeats a process or action a number of times or until a condition is met. Iterations are also called loops, and can be useful when you need to repeat certain tasks over and over again. There are many types of iterations that I have not gone over yet such as: (do while), (while) (continue).



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The roles in pair programming are: Driver and Navigator. The driver's role is to write the actual code - as if they were driving a car on the road. The navigator's role is to check the map so the driver ends at the correct location. Proper techniques in pair programming should consist of the navigator checking for typos, and making sure the driver is on the right path. For the driver it is being able to translate what the navigator is saying into code. One role is not more important than the other, and if done correctly it is like the mental load of coding is cut in half and shared between the pair.

  Researched answer: Proper programming techniques will see both individuals understand the why and how the code is working. It is up to the pair to continuously talk and work through a problem so that both individuals grow and learn together. I think the most important technique pair programmers could use regardless of position is how to properly communicate.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are functions that either take in a function or return a function.

2. Jest: JavaScript testing framework. Has its own built in methods that need to be considered when testing.

3. Objects: An intersection of data and behavior. Objects have keys which helps identify them, and values that can be entered to further sort the object. (animal(key): "dog(value)")

4. Method: a method is when there is a function in an object.

5. Classes: classes are blueprints for objects. A type of function. Names are PascalCased (first letter capitalized). Is this why other names are camelCase - so they are not seen as classes?
